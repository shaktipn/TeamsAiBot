  Validates a web token (WT) from a web app. Returns the associated user identity and possibly
  a new WT (If the current one is about to expire).
request:
  - name: wt
    type: String
response:
  - name: userIdentity
    type: UserIdentity
  - name: wt
    type: WebToken
    optional: true

      This is returned only if the WT in the request is about to expire.
      For example: If the WT validity time is 5 mins. If a request is made after 4 mins of creating the WT,
      a new WT is created and returned.
